### More Information
I'm still noob programmer  
Favorite food is "Chicken Ramen + egg + Kimchi".

I create a web service in a LAMP environment at the university, and writing an image processing algorithm in Scilab. Now I learn about distributed processing that was bitten by the Hadoop to RaspberyPi + RAID.Programming language you are learning is sometimes C (C ++, C #) and PHP and Ruby and is Python.
I also like to make a web service is or was the image processing system algorithm, a general sort algorithm is currently in desperate to learn. In addition, since college major was the hardware system, also spear sometimes electronic tools using PIC micon and RaspberryPi, mbet.
