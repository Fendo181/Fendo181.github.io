### More Information
I'm still noob programmer  
Favorite food is "Chicken Ramen add egg add Kimchi".

I create a web service in a LAMP environment at the university, and writing an image processing algorithm in Scilab. Now I learn about distributed processing that was bitten by the Hadoop to RaspberyPi + RAID.Programming language you are learning is sometimes C (C ++, C #) and PHP and Ruby and is Python.
I also like to make a web service is or was the image processing system algorithm, a general sort algorithm is currently in desperate to learn. In addition, since college major was the hardware system, also spear sometimes electronic tools using PIC microcontrollers and RaspberryPi, the mbet.

thanks :-)
